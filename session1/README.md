# Session 1: Comparative Languages

In session 1 we will take a look at 4 very different and very popular languages to get a feel for
some of design choices they each make, and think about the types of problems each would be best
suited to solving. We will continue to use all of these languages through out the course to 
demonstrate various topics. So in the first segment of the session we start off by
getting all of the languages set up on our environment, and writing a simple hello world.
