# Session 1: Comparative Languages and Introduction

In session 1 we will take a look at 4 very different and very popular systems languages(Go, C, C++, Rust) to get a feel for design choices they each make, and think about the types of problems each would be best
suited to solving. We will continue to use all of these languages through out the course to 
demonstrate various topics. 

## Ex1: Setup programming environment and write hello world.

## Ex2: Explore structure features of the four languages.

## Ex3: Memory Management

## Ex4: Idiomatic http server comparison and benchmarks.

## Ex5: Standard Library Zoo.

## Ex6: System calls.

## Ex7: Test writing and package management.
