# Session 2: Algorithms and Data Structures

In this module we explore the most important topics of modern Algorithm and data structure
design and usage.  We will be using all of our comparative languages from earlier to see some of their
strengths and weaknesses here.  Also we will explore any standard library implementations
of important algorithms in the languages.
